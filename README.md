# Library Management System

## Global AI Hub's Aygaz Python Bootcamp:

This project is a part of the Global AI Hub's Aygaz Python Bootcamp, where participants learn essential Python programming concepts and apply them to real-world projects. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce the understanding of object-oriented programming, file I/O operations, and error handling in Python.

## Description:

This project implements a Library Management System using object-oriented programming techniques in Python. The system utilizes a text file (books.txt) as a database, where each line represents a single book with information such as the book title, author, release date, and number of pages separated by commas.

### Features:

* List Books: Display all books stored in the books.txt file.
* Add Book: Add a new book to the books.txt file by providing the book title, author, release year, and number of pages.
* Remove Book: Remove a book from the books.txt file by entering its title. Only exact matches are removed.

### Implementation:

The project consists of a Python class Library with methods to perform the aforementioned features.
The Library class utilizes file I/O operations to read and modify the books.txt file.
A menu-based interface allows users to interact with the library system, choosing options to list books, add books, remove books, or quit the program.
Error handling is implemented to ensure robustness and provide user-friendly messages in case of invalid inputs or file operations.
